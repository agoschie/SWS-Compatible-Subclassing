# SWS-Compatible-Subclassing
Reaper uses ANSI windows based on SWELL, which extends parts of the Win32 API to MacOS and Linux; however, there are limitations remedied by libraries developed for Reaper, such as SWS. SWS-Compatible-Subclassing will provide true multi-user extendibility of window procedure subclassing that remains compatible with SWS, SWELL, and thus Reaper.
